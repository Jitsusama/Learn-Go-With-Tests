This is my walkthrough of the excellent https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ Go learning book.

The folder names more or less match up with the chapter names, and the commits line up with the various milestones I made during this journey. The further I got in and the more comfortable I got with Go, the more I deviated from simply retyping what the book presented. In some chapters I didn't quite write all the code the book presented if I felt I had learned enough by doing for that chapter.
